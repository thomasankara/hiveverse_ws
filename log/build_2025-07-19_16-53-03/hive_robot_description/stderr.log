[31mCMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:8 (find_package):
  By not providing "Findros_gz_bridge.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this
  project has asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by
  "ros_gz_bridge", but CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "ros_gz_bridge"
  with any of the following names:

    ros_gz_bridgeConfig.cmake
    ros_gz_bridge-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "ros_gz_bridge" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "ros_gz_bridge_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If
  "ros_gz_bridge" provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it
  has been installed.
